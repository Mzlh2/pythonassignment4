Key Features of NumPy
a. Fast Computation
b. NumPy is written in C, so calculations are much faster than normal Python lists.
c. Supports Multi-Dimensional Arrays
d. easily create 1D, 2D, 3D… arrays (like mathematical matrices).
e. Powerful Mathematical Functions
NumPy has built-in functions for:
-mean, median, sum
-matrix multiplication
-reshaping arrays
-linear algebra operations
f. Less Memory Usage- NumPy stores data in compact form, so it uses less memory than Python lists.
g. Vectorised Operations- can perform operations on whole arrays without loops.
Example: arr * 2 multiplies every element instantly.

Differences Between NumPy Arrays and Python Lists 
Feature	        Python List     	       NumPy Array
Speed:	        Slow	                   Very fast
Data Type:	    Can store mixed          Only one data type allowed
                types (e.g., int
                + string)	
Memory:	        Uses more memory	       Uses less memory
Mathematical    Needs loops (slow)	     Direct operations (fast)
Operations:	
Multi-          Hard to create,          Easy to create matrix-like arrays
Dimensional:    2D/3D lists  
		
Usage:          General purpose	         Mainly for scientific/maths data
