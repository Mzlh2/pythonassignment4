Key Features of NumPy
a. Fast Computation
b. NumPy is written in C, so calculations are much faster than normal Python lists.
c. Supports Multi-Dimensional Arrays
d. easily create 1D, 2D, 3D… arrays (like mathematical matrices).
e. Powerful Mathematical Functions
NumPy has built-in functions for:
-mean, median, sum
-matrix multiplication
-reshaping arrays
-linear algebra operations
f. Less Memory Usage- NumPy stores data in compact form, so it uses less memory than Python lists.
g. Vectorised Operations- can perform operations on whole arrays without loops.
Example: arr * 2 multiplies every element instantly.

Differences Between NumPy Arrays and Python Lists 
| Feature                       | Python List                                | NumPy Array                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Speed**                     | Slow                                       | Very fast                         |
| **Data Type**                 | Can store mixed types (e.g., int + string) | Only one data type allowed        |
| **Memory**                    | Uses more memory                           | Uses less memory                  |
| **Mathematical Operations**   | Needs loops (slow)                         | Direct operations (fast)          |
| **Multi-Dimensional Support** | Hard to create 2D/3D lists                 | Easy to create matrix-like arrays |
| **Usage**                     | General purpose                            | Mainly for scientific/maths data  |
